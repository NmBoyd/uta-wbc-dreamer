  <description brief="PR2 controller plugin for Stanford_WBC.">
    This package contains an adaptation of the Stanford Whole-Body
    Control Framework (WBC) for PR2. It relies mainly on the
    joint-space dynamic model which is part of WBC. There is a "pump"
    controller plugin which sends robot state from real-time to
    user-space and the torque commands back from user-space into the
    real-time controller. For simpler WBC operations, it would
    (probably) be possible to run the entire WBC servo within the
    plugin, but tests in late 2009 (which were based on a very
    complete set of WBC functionality) failed in this respect because
    they were too slow to fit within the 1kHz RT control loop on PR2.
